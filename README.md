### Hi there üëã

I am **Xiangming Gu**. You can also call me **Brian**. I am currently a final-year Ph.D. candidate at **[National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg)**, supervised by Prof. **[Ye Wang](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/wangye/)**. Before that, I earned my B.E. degree of Electronic Engineering and B.S. degree of Finance at **[Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/)**.

I am a student research at **[Google Deepmind](https://deepmind.google)** in London, United Kingdom, where I am hosted by Dr. **[Petar Veliƒçkoviƒá](https://petar-v.com)** and Dr. **[Larisa Markeeva](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=jM6Y0yAAAAAJ&hl=en)**. I was lucky to be mentored by Dr. **[Tianyu Pang](https://p2333.github.io/)** and Dr. **[Chao Du](https://duchao0726.github.io/)** at **[Sea AI lab (SAIL)](https://sail.sea.com/)**, where I worked closely with Dr. **[Qian Liu](https://siviltaram.github.io/)**, and Dr. **[Min Lin](https://linmin.me/)**.
