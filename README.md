### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am **Xiangming Gu**. You can also call me **Brian**. I am currently a final-year Ph.D. candidate from **[NUS Sound and Music Computing Lab](https://smcnus.github.io)**, where I am supervised by Prof. **[Ye Wang](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/wangye/)**. I am affilated to **[Integrative Sciences and Engineering Programme](https://isep.nus.edu.sg)** and **[School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg)** at **[National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg)**. Before that, I obtained my B.E. degree of Electronic Engineering and B.S. degree of Finance at **[Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/)**.

I am a student research at **[Google Deepmind](https://deepmind.google)** in London, United Kingdom. I was a research intern at **[Sea AI lab (SAIL)](https://sail.sea.com/)**, where I was mentored by Dr. **[Tianyu Pang](https://p2333.github.io/)** and Dr. **[Chao Du](https://duchao0726.github.io/)**, and worked closely with Dr. **[Qian Liu](https://siviltaram.github.io/)**, and Dr. **[Min Lin](https://linmin.me/)**.

Currently, my main research focus is **understanding, advancing and safety deployment of generative models**. During my earlier Ph.D. journey, I have done some work on bayesian deep learning, and application of machine learning to singing/speech domain.
