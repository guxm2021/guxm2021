### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am **Xiangming Gu**. You can also call me **Brian**. I am currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate from **[NUS Sound and Music Computing Lab](https://smcnus.github.io)**, where I am supervised by Prof. **[Ye Wang](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/wangye/)**. I am affilated to **[Integrative Sciences and Engineering Programme](https://isep.nus.edu.sg)** and **[School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg)** at **[National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg)**. Before that, I obtained my B.E. degree of Electronic Engineering and B.S. degree of Finance at **[Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/)**.

My research interests include two directions: (i) fundamental research for generative models and (multimodal) large language models; (ii) application of machine learning, e.g. multimodal learning, multi-distribution learning (domain adaptation), and trustworthy machine learning (fairness, memorization), to singing/speech techniques.
